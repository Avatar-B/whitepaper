# Rocks

This is where and how things happen in each [metaverse](../metaverses.md). Rocks are foundations for Rovers to build, host, and participate in [social](../../hang-out-in-the-immersive-web/social-experiences.md), gaming, commerce, work, and learning experiences.

Rocks have attributes common to their local metaverses – such as density, size, color, location, and gravity. These attributes shape how Rovers create and participate in experiences.

## A bottom-up approach to NFT design

Typically, products have a top-down approach. The product solves one specific problem and defines many specific in-product NFTs. For example, a game could define various specific in-game NFTs for its users.

Rocks take a bottom-up approach. Rocks are general-purpose NFTs - the foundation for Rovers to build different experiences on top of.

Think of Rock attributes as basic primitives that can be used in infinite ways – like a deck of cards. Creators can interpret these attributes however they like to build unique and engaging experiences – like Blackjack or Poker.
