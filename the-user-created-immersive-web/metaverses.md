# Metaverses

![Rove is composed of user-created, organic, ever-evolving metaverses.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-01-14 at 2.29.31 PM.png>)

Rove is an open system of user-created metaverses. Anyone can create a metaverse for their community, common interest group, shared cause, and any reason for people to come together. \

Metaverse economies are powered by [experiences](broken-reference). Assets that can be bought and sold include [rocks](rocks/) to host each experience, tickets to participate in them, and objects to enhance them.

Each metaverse is [owned and operated by its inhabitants](../web3/user-owned-governance.md). They decide how their metaverse is run, and how their digital economy works. The Founder is the first governor of that metaverse and can release control to the community by distributing rocks. Rock owners co-own and co-operate.&#x20;
