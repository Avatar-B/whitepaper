# What is Rove?

![Create and explore web3 experiences.](.gitbook/assets/metaverse.png)

**Rove is open infrastructure for creating infinite metaverses.**&#x20;

Everything in the Rove System is permissionless by design. Anyone can create their own metaverse, populate it with diverse virtual experiences, and operate it freely outside the jurisdiction of centralized institutions and corporations.&#x20;

Rove runs on Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon, EVM-compatible and established blockchains. As the industry matures, more networks will be added over time.&#x20;

**Rove is the toolkit for creating and monetizing virtual experiences.**

Rove equips creators with no-code tools to host content in both familiar and exciting new mediums: VR, 3D, Streaming, Audio, Video, etc. The toolkit is designed to encourage creativity; specialized skills are not needed and anyone can create value on web3.

It also gives them fairer opportunities to monetize their content. Creators decide what they earn, not platforms. They have sole control over everything they create, including all their content and any NFT assets.&#x20;

**Rove is your corner of the new web.**

Finding weird and awesome little communities, sharing a joke with a stranger, stumbling onto history being made – that’s what we like about the internet. Not the tech monopolies and the rules they set.&#x20;

That's why we're building Rove. So you can create whatever _you_ want.
