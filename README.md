# What is Rove?

![Hang out in the immersive web.](<.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

**Rove** is your new corner of the web. It’s **3D**. It’s **immersive**. And **you own it**.

## T**he 3D web**

Rove is an infinitely expanding network of **real-time 3D virtual worlds**. These 3D virtual worlds are immersive; they give you a sense of presence. Their states are also persistent and synchronized among all Rovers.

The basic building blocks for creating 3D virtual worlds in Rove are:&#x20;

* [Metaverses](the-3d-web/metaverses.md)
* [Rocks](the-3d-web/rocks/)
* [Environments](the-3d-web/environments.md)
* [Objects](the-3d-web/objects.md)

## Immersive experiences

Once Rove is fully developed, the community can build any immersive experience on Rove – social, gaming, commerce, work, learning, and more.

At launch, we will focus on [social experiences](immersive-experiences/social-experiences.md) first. We think social is a good starting point from which to grow Rove. Fundamentally, virtual worlds are about people. How they come together, and how they interact in these new worlds. How they self-organize and create. These interactions determine the richness of any given reality – whether physical or digital.

Within Rove, social experiences can be as big or small as you want them. A fancy apartment or a leaky tent. Sit next to your best friend and chat through a movie. Host your next community AMA around a campfire. Throw a house party in VR.

## User-created, user-operated, and user-owned

Everything in the Rove System is permissionless by design. Anyone can create their own space and operate it freely outside the jurisdiction of centralized institutions and corporations.

Rove challenges the prescribed future of a winner-takes-all metaverse, where reality is dictated by monopolistic, centralized corporations. We don’t need to amplify web2 issues across additional dimensions.

Our goal is to open the internet so everyone can own a piece. You hold the keys to it, and everything in it.
