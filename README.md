# What is Rove?

![Rovers hanging out in Rove.](<.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

**Rove** is your new corner of the web. It’s **3D**. It’s **immersive**. And **you own Rove**.

## Rove is 3D.

Rove is an infinitely expanding network of **real-time 3D virtual worlds**. These 3D virtual worlds are immersive; they give you a sense of presence. They are also persistent; their states are synched among all Rovers in real-time.

3D virtual worlds in Rove are **user-created**. The **basic building blocks** for Rovers to create 3D virtual worlds are [metaverses](the-3d-web/metaverses.md), [rocks](the-3d-web/rocks/), [environments](the-3d-web/environments.md), and [objects](the-3d-web/objects.md).

Rove is accessible via multiple interfaces. Rovers can create and explore 3D virtual worlds via a web browser, on both **desktop** and **mobile**. And for the most immersive experience, use **VR headsets**.

## Rove is immersive.

Rove takes a [bottom-up design approach](https://whitepaper.rove.to/rove/the-3d-web/rocks#a-bottom-up-approach-to-nft-design) so that the community can create any **immersive experience** they can imagine – social, gaming, commerce, work, learning, and more. Experiences on Rove are live, immersive, and persistent.

At launch, we will focus on [social experiences](immersive-experiences/social-experiences.md) first. We think social is a good starting point from which to grow Rove. Fundamentally, virtual worlds are about people. How they come together, and how they interact in these new worlds. How they self-organize and create. These interactions determine the richness of any given reality – whether physical or digital.

Within Rove, social experiences can be as big or small as you want them. A fancy apartment or a leaky tent. Sit next to your best friend and chat through a movie. Host your next community AMA around a campfire. Throw a house party in VR.

## And you own Rove.

Rove challenges the prescribed future of a winner-takes-all metaverse, where reality is dictated by monopolistic, centralized corporations. We don’t need to amplify web2 issues across additional dimensions.

Everything in the Rove System is permissionless by design. Anyone can create their own space and operate it freely outside the jurisdiction of centralized institutions and corporations.

Our goal is to open the internet so everyone can own a piece. You hold the keys to it, and everything in it.
