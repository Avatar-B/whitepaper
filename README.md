  Rove is where anyone can create a metaverse. Where anyone can host, discover,
  and monetize any sort of digital experience. People are in charge here, not
  corporations or algorithms.

# What is Rove?

## An open system of user-created metaverses

Rove challenges the prescribed future of a winner-takes-all metaverse, where reality is dictated by monopolistic, centralized corporations. We donâ€™t need to amplify web2 issues across additional dimensions. We need to open the internet so everyone can own a piece.

Rove is permissionless. That means anyone can create a new [metaverse](broken-reference) or take part in an existing one, making the internet fairer and probably much more fun.

Each metaverse is [owned and operated by its inhabitants](broken-reference). Participants determine how their metaverse is run, and how their digital economy works.

Assets in Rove are owned by Rovers, not the Rove system. Rovers hold their own private keys and have sole control over their assets, represented by cryptographic **non-fungible tokens** (NFTs). Unstoppable **smart contracts** are used to program relationships between these assets.
