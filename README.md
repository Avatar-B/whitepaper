# What is Rove?

![Create and explore web3 experiences.](.gitbook/assets/metaverse.png)

****\
**Rove is an open infrastructure for the immersive web.**&#x20;

Everything in the Rove System is permissionless by design. Anyone can create their own space and operate it freely outside the jurisdiction of centralized institutions and corporations.&#x20;

Rove runs on Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon, EVM-compatible, and established blockchains. Networks will be added as the industry matures.

**Rove is your corner of the new web.**

It can be as big or small as you want it. A fancy apartment or a leaky tent. Sit next to your best friend and chat through a movie. Host your next community AMA around a campfire. Throw a house party in VR.

You hold the keys to it, and everything in it.&#x20;
