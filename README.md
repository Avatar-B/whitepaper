  friends. Be with your favorite people in your very own corner of the
  metaverse.

# What is Rove?

![Rove is dotted with little pockets of people just hanging out.](<.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

**Rove** is your new corner of the web. It’s **3D**. It’s **immersive**. And **it's yours.**

## Rove is 3D.

Rove **** is an infinitely expanding web of **user-created** **3D virtual worlds**. These 3D virtual worlds are **immersive**; they give you a sense of presence. They are **persistent**; their states are saved and synced among all Rovers. They are **real-time**; they are being rendered constantly to all devices accessing them.

Rove is accessible via multiple devices. Rovers can create and explore 3D virtual worlds via a web browser, on both **desktop** and **mobile**. And for the most immersive experience, **VR headsets**.

3D virtual worlds in Rove are **user-created**. The **basic building blocks** for Rovers to create 3D virtual worlds are [metaverses](the-3d-web/metaverses.md), [rocks](the-3d-web/rocks/), [environments](the-3d-web/environments.md), and [objects](the-3d-web/objects.md).

## Rove is immersive.

Digital experiences in Rove are **immersive**. You're not just watching them; you're in them. They are experiences you can participate in, and be part of.&#x20;

Rove takes a [bottom-up design approach](https://whitepaper.rove.to/rove/the-3d-web/rocks#a-bottom-up-approach-to-nft-design) so that the community can create any experience they can imagine – social, gaming, commerce, work, learning, and more.&#x20;

At launch, we will focus on [social experiences](immersive-experiences/experiences.md). We think social is a good starting point from which to grow Rove. Fundamentally, virtual worlds are about people. How they come together, and how they interact in these new worlds. How they self-organize and create. These interactions determine the richness of any given reality – whether physical or digital.

Within Rove, social experiences can be as big or small as you want them. A fancy apartment or a leaky tent. Sit next to your best friend and chat through a movie. Host your next community AMA around a campfire. Throw a house party in VR.

## You own Rove.

**Assets in Rove are owned by Rovers**, not Rove. Rovers hold their own private keys and have sole control over their assets, represented by cryptographic non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unstoppable smart contracts are used to program relationships between these assets.

Everything in the Rove System is **permissionless by design**. Anyone can create their own space and operate it freely outside the jurisdiction of centralized institutions and corporations.

Rove challenges the prescribed future of a winner-takes-all metaverse, where reality is dictated by monopolistic, centralized corporations. We don’t need to amplify web2 issues across additional dimensions.&#x20;

Our goal is to open the internet so everyone can own a piece. **You hold the keys to it, and everything in it**.
