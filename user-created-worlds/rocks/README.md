# Rocks

![A metaverse, composed of rocks with different attributes.](../../.gitbook/assets/Rove.039.jpeg)

This is where and how things happen in each [metaverse](broken-reference). Rocks are foundations for Rovers to build, host, and participate in [social](broken-reference), gaming, commerce, work, and learning experiences.

Rocks have attributes common to their local metaverses – such as density, size, color, location, and gravity. These attributes shape how Rovers create and participate in experiences.

Think of Rock attributes as basic primitives that can be used in infinite ways – like a deck of cards. Creators can interpret these attributes however they like to build unique and engaging experiences – like Blackjack or Poker.

## Get a rock

Rovers acquire rocks in a few different ways:

* Buy a rock from another Rover
* [Spawn a new rock](rock-spawning.md) with blended attributes from 2 existing rocks.

## Rock owners

Rock owners are important players in each metaverse. They can:

* Host experiences on the rock&#x20;
* Rent the rock out other Rovers
* Customize the rock
* Sell the rock for a profit&#x20;
* Spawn a new rock
* Govern the metaverse the rock is located in
