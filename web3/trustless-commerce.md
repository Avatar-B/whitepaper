# Trustless commerce

Everything in the Rove System is permissionless by design. Assets in Rove are owned by Rovers, not the Rove system. Rovers hold their own private keys and have sole control over their assets, represented by cryptographic **non-fungible tokens** (NFTs).&#x20;

Buying and selling assets are done via trustless **smart contracts**.

## The Rove Marketplace

Within Rove, every piece of user-created content is an NFT asset. Assets that can be bought and sold on the Rove Marketplace include:

* [Rocks](../the-user-created-immersive-web/rocks/)
* Environments&#x20;
* [Objects](../the-user-created-immersive-web/objects.md)
* [Experiences](../hang-out-in-the-immersive-web/what-is-a-social-experience.md)

And more as Rove evolves.
