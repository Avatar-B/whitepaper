### Social experiences

Fundamentally, Rove is about people. How they come together, and how they interact in these new worlds. How they self-organize and create. These interactions determine the richness of any given reality – whether physical or digital.

We think social is a good starting point from which to grow the Rove System.

Social experiences on Rove are immersive, live, and interactive. Creators have access to a variety of ready-to-use tools to produce content for different mediums – audio, video, streaming, spatial, and VR. Rove also supports new devices like VR headsets.

### Which attributes do social experiences use?

The first social experiences will be built on Voronoi rocks, using a few Voronoi attributes as basic primitives.

* Diameter: The diameter attribute indicates the capacity of an event. The larger the rock is, the more participants it can host.
* Complexity: The more complexity a rock has, the more complex an event it can host. For example, a low-complexity rock might only support audio features and be perfect for a podcast, but rock with higher complexity might be needed to host a VR event.
* Gravity: Social experiences in VR will use the gravity attribute to hang out while bending physics.

Each social experience is an NFT. The ExperienceNFT smart contract is here.
