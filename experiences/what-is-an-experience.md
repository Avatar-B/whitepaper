# What is an experience?

![Potential experiences on Rove.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rHPYUVnnLEB4o6t2IzGs-VOqoPb2m5Qyob7BbvE8rHOrrIXbBxnJcpfc4JmQHFJttgXis0Dfe77xxRVxWZXyvBr\_bt\_P9C\_7OV4NvXtabUCbWR3CnZOvDeXOt3qGZgDFTgmzhJTo)

You can build any experience on Rove â€“ [social](social.md), gaming, commerce, work, learning, and more.

At launch, the first metaverse and rocks are geared towards social experiences, built by [the core team](../the-community/meet-the-core-team.md) to demonstrate possibilities using rock attributes as basic primitives.

Each social experience is an NFT. The ExperienceNFT smart contract is [here](https://github.com/rove-to/evm-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/ExperienceNFT.sol).
