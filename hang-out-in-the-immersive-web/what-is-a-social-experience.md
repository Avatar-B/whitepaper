# What is a social experience?

You can build any experience on Rove – [social](what-is-a-social-experience.md), gaming, commerce, work, learning, and more.

At launch, the first metaverse and rocks are geared towards social experiences, built by [the core team](../the-community/meet-the-core-team.md) to demonstrate possibilities using rock attributes as basic primitives.

## Social experiences

Fundamentally, Rove is about people. How they come together, and how they interact in these new worlds. How they self-organize and create. These interactions determine the richness of any given reality – whether physical or digital.

We think social is a good starting point from which to grow the Rove System.

## Which attributes do social experiences use?

The first social experiences will be built on Voronoi rocks, using a few Voronoi attributes as basic primitives.

* **Diameter:** The diameter attribute indicates the capacity of an event. The larger the rock is, the more participants it can host.
* **Complexity:** The more complexity a rock has, the more complex an event it can host. For example, a low-complexity rock might only support a small hangout and be perfect for a group of friends, but rock with higher complexity might be needed to host a large-scale VR event.
* **Gravity:** Social experiences in VR will use the gravity attribute to hang out while bending physics.
