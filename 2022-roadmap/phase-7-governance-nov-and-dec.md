# Phase 7: Governance (Nov & Dec)

This is a major phase. Rovers will begin to [co-operate Rove](broken-reference) as co-owners.

* Submit a proposal
* Vote on current proposals
* Work on a proposal and earn money

Decentralized governance is difficult. We expect to learn a lot from this phase and iteratively improve Rove governance together with the community as we go.
