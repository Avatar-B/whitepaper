# Overview

![2022 product roadmap](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

The core team is working on 3 parallel initiatives in 2022.

* **The 3D web**: an open infrastructure for Rovers to architect, design and build 3D virtual worlds. Collectively, these 3D virtual worlds form the 3D web.
* **Immersive experiences**: an easy-to-use product for Rovers to socialize in 3D virtual worlds. Social underpins everything, so our focus this year is to get social experiences right.
* **Web3**: decentralized tools to support community governance. And deploying Rove on as many cryptonetworks as possible.
