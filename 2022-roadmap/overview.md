# Overview

![2022 product roadmap](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

The core team is working on 3 parallel initiatives in 2022.

* **The 3D web**: building an open infrastructure for Rovers to architect, design, and build 3D virtual worlds. Collectively, these 3D virtual worlds form the 3D web.
* **Immersive experiences**: building an easy-to-use product for Rovers to socialize in 3D virtual worlds. Our focus is to get social experiences right first.
* **Web3**: building decentralized tools to progress Rove towards a community-run platform. And deploying Rove on as many cryptonetworks as possible.
