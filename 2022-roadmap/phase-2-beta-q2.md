# Phase 2: Beta (Mar)

The first priority is to fix bugs and fine-tune key features based on the community feedback on the Alpha version. &#x20;

In this release, we will see crypto elements incorporated into Rove, including the [Rove token](broken-reference) and the NFT [smart contracts](https://github.com/rove-to/evm-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts) of [metaverses](broken-reference), [rocks](broken-reference), and [experiences](broken-reference).&#x20;

The Beta release will be deployed on the Ethereum testnet.

Additionally,

* [Metaverses](broken-reference): Anyone can mint a metaverse with default attributes
* [Rocks](broken-reference): The second rock family, Metaball, will be added
* [Experiences](broken-reference): Creators will be able to do some basic customization on their experiences&#x20;
