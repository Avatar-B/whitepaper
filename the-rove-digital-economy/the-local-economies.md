# The local economies

Each metaverse is governed independently and operates its own local economy, with assets like  rocks, experiences, tickets, and objects.

**Assets**\
\
Assets in Rove are owned by Rovers, not the Rove system. Rovers hold their own private keys and have sole control over their assets, represented by cryptographic **non-fungible tokens** (NFTs). Unstoppable **smart contracts** are used to program relationships between these assets.

**Governance**

Each metaverse is a DAO with its own local governance. Rock owners are members that can vote on local policies. Metaverse DAOs work to maximize the growth of their local economy.

Metaverse DAOs can set their own policies. Here are some examples.

**Taxes**&#x20;

* Set local sales taxes&#x20;
* Set local rock taxes

**Expenditures**&#x20;

* Reward Creators&#x20;
* Reward Rovers who participate in experiences&#x20;
* Fund growth activities (i.e. airdrops, community building, partnerships, etc.)

**Others**&#x20;

* Set genesis rock prices&#x20;
* Set local rock spawning fees&#x20;
* Set local experience hosting fees
