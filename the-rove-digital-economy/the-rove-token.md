# The Rove token

## ROVE utilities

Rove Token (ROVE) is the native cryptocurrency of Rove. It is a utility token used for all transactions across all metaverses within Rove.

Use ROVE to:

* Mint a metaverse
* Buy a rock
* Spawn a rock
* Rent a rock
* Buy an environment
* Buy a cool object to decorate your rock&#x20;
* Buy a ticket to attend your favorite experience

And more as the Rove economy grows.

## ROVE tokenomics

Rove tokenomics will be community-driven, and designed to reward active contribution over passive capital investment. The goal is to put Rove tokens directly into the hands of those who are consistently creating meaningful value for the Rove system and the Rove community.&#x20;

To this end, tokenomics will be finalized and released at the Public launch, based on feedback from the Alpha and Beta releases.&#x20;

**Alpha and Beta releases**\
\
These early releases will allow us to study and fine-tune the Rove economy, as well as receive input from a growing community. Hang out with your friends in the immersive web and help improve Rove before the Public launch!

Testnet ROVE will be given to users who want to mint their own metaverses, spawn their own rocks, customize their own environments, and trade cool objects.&#x20;
