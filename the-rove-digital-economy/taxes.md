# Taxes

Rovers decide on taxation policies that best support their local and global economy. There are two types of taxes: sales taxes on transactions and rock taxes (similar to property taxes).

Rovers pay local taxes to their local Metaverse DAO (similar to state taxes), and global taxes to the global Rove DAO (similar to federal taxes).
