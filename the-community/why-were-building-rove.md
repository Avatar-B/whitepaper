# Why we're building Rove

![Our vision for web3.](../.gitbook/assets/closedmetaverse.png)

Rove challenges the prescribed future of a winner-takes-all metaverse, where reality is dictated by monopolistic, centralized corporations. We donâ€™t need to amplify web2 issues across additional dimensions.\
\
Our mission is to open the internet so everyone can own a piece.
