# Rock ownership

## Rock owners

Rock owners are important players in each metaverse. They can:

* Host experiences on the rock&#x20;
* Rent the rock out other Rovers
* Customize the rock
* Sell the rock for a profit&#x20;
* Spawn a new rock
* Govern the metaverse the rock is located in

And more as Rove evolves.

## How to get a rock

Rovers acquire rocks in a few different ways:

* **Buy** a rock from another Rover
* [Spawn a new rock](rock-spawning.md) with blended attributes from 2 existing rocks.

Or Rover can just **rent** a rock from another Rover.
