Anyone can spawn a new rock with blended attributes from 2 existing rocks.&#x20;

Spawning is unpredictable. A genetic algorithm first creates the offspring of two rocks, then randomly performs mutation. The result is a new, unique foundation for new, unique experiences.

More actions will be added over time, such as fusing (combining multiple rocks into one) and splitting (the reverse process).
