# Rock families

![Different rock families will be introduced over time.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YyOlr0MWH6kiYLQqaonUlu1JsY07gzszXhwORoqu6\_8dkG2R\_36GlSWl-n8LrYaOvspeXQbwx00ad2ajWKVDySj1--HUSqTBo88Io8xaK7CGTCystI4kCwZW\_\_lRzYld0M-1NHV-)



When a metaverse is formed, the founder chooses its rock family. Attributes differ between families; for example, rocks in the Voronoi family have density and color attributes, while Metaball rocks share texture and energy attributes.

How these attributes are interpreted is up to the creator. For example, a VR experience may use the gravity attribute of a Voronoi rock to give their users the power of flight, or simply let them hang out in the air with other Rovers. An RPG could use the energy attribute of a Metaball rock to let players recharge, or power up.
