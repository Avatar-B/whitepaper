Each rock is a special kind of NFT – it evolves. Rock attributes dynamically change over time. Some changes are outwardly visible to Rovers in the metaverse, like size and color. Some are not, like gravity.

These dynamic attributes can add to the depth of each experience. To expand on the previous examples, the VR experience could allow users to fly higher as gravity decreases. The RPG could limit the number of concurrent players based on the size of the rock. Creator’s choice.
